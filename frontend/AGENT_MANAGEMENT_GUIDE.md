# Agent Management Guide

## Overview
The Transparent AI Agent Hub allows you to manage your personal collection of AI agents. You can add free agents directly to your library, request access to premium agents, and remove agents as needed.

## How to Add Agents to Your Library

### Free Agents (Like Gemini)
1. **Navigate to the Global Library** - This shows all available agents
2. **Find the Gemini Chat Agent** - Look for "Gemini Chat Agent" in the list
3. **Click "Add to Library"** - The button should be visible if the agent is free
4. **Agent Added Successfully** - The button will change to "Remove"

### Premium Agents
1. **Find the Premium Agent** - Look for agents marked as "Premium" or "Enterprise"
2. **Click "Request Access"** - This submits a request for approval
3. **Wait for Approval** - An admin will review your request
4. **Get Notified** - You'll receive an email when approved

## How to Remove Agents

1. **Go to "My Library"** - This shows agents currently in your library
2. **Find the Agent** - Locate the agent you want to remove
3. **Click "Remove"** - The button should now show "Remove" instead of "Add"
4. **Confirm Removal** - A dialog will ask for confirmation
5. **Agent Removed** - The agent is removed from your library

## How to Re-add Agents

1. **Go to "Global Library"** - Navigate back to see all available agents
2. **Find the Agent** - Locate the agent you previously removed
3. **Click "Add to Library"** - The button should be available again
4. **Agent Re-added** - The agent is back in your library

## Troubleshooting

### If "Add to Library" Button is Missing
- **Check if you're signed in** - You must be authenticated
- **Check agent tier** - Premium agents show "Request Access" instead
- **Check if already in library** - The button changes to "Remove" if already added

### If Agent Won't Add
- **Check console for errors** - Open browser dev tools (F12)
- **Check network tab** - Look for failed API calls
- **Use Debug Panel** - Click the "Debug" button in the stats section

The debug panel (accessible via the "Debug" button) will:
- Show your user profile information

- Test agent addition/removal
- Provide detailed error information
