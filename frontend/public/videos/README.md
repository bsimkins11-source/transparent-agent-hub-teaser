# Demo Videos

This directory contains the demo videos for the agent cards. The videos are displayed as static placeholders with "Watch Demo" buttons that open full-screen shadowbox players.

## How It Works
- **Static Placeholders**: Agent cards show a placeholder with video title and "Watch Demo" button
- **Shadowbox Playback**: Clicking "Watch Demo" opens the video in a full-screen modal
- **No Inline Playback**: Videos only play in the shadowbox for better user experience
